/**
@file SequenceRecords.hh
@brief Collection of SequenceRecord objects that holds all
data associated with input sequences and corrected sequences
@details Holds all SequenceRecord objects associated with an
ErrorX query. In addition it holds ErrorXOptions that has 
settings for processing, DataScaler that scales the input
data, and ErrorPredictor that does the error correction itself.
