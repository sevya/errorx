@brief Collection of SequenceRecord objects that holds all
data associated with input sequences and corrected sequences
@details Holds all SequenceRecord objects associated with an
ErrorX query. In addition it holds ErrorXOptions that has 
settings for processing, and ErrorPredictor that does the error correction itself.
