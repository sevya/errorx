\subsection{Detailed Description}
Collection of Sequence\+Record objects that holds all data associated with input sequences and corrected sequences. 

Holds all Sequence\+Record objects associated with an ErrorX query. In addition it holds Error\+X\+Options that has settings for processing, Data\+Scaler that scales the input data, and Error\+Predictor that does the error correction itself. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
