\subsection{Detailed Description}
The features extracted from a nucleotide sequence to be used for neural network processing and error correction. 

This class calculates, from an NT sequence, the features that are used in the NN implementation. It is then given to Error\+Predictor to do the actual transformation and prediction. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
