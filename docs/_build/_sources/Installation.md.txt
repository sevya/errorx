# Installation

To install ErrorX, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/sevya/errorx/releases) page on the ErrorX Github account. Once you have downloaded the zipped archive for your operating system (this will have the extension `.tar.gz`), you are ready to unpack the folder and starting running.

Run the following command to extract the files from the archive:

	tar xvfz ErrorX-1.0_mac.tar.gz
You can also use a third-party software such as [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the files. 
	
The ErrorX binary is ready to go from there - it is located at `ErrorX/bin/errorx`

**Note:** the binary relies on data contained in the ErrorX folder. For best results, leave the directory structure of ErrorX intact.
