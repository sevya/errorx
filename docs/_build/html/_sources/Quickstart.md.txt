# Quickstart

After installing ErrorX you are ready to run your first sequences. You can find example sequences to use as an example in the `ErrorX/documentation/` folder. Use the following command to run ErrorX prediction:

`ErrorX/bin/errorx --species human --format fastq --out ErrorX_out.tsv --allow-nonproductive ExampleSequences.fastq`

You will find a tab-separated file called `ErrorX_out.tsv` with all the annotated sequences and their predicted errors.
