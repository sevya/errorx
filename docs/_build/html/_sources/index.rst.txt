Overview2
=========

ErrorX is a software package for correction of DNA sequencing errors. In next-generation sequencing, it's common that many of the output sequences are actually errors, different from the input DNA sequence. This can be caused by the way the DNA was prepared, amplification before sequencing, and errors introduced by the sequencing machine itself. Unfortunately, these errors can be very costly to a next-generation sequencing pipeline, as you can never be sure which sequences are true and which are mistakes.

ErrorX solves this problem by using deep neural networks to predict sites where an error has been introduced. Trained on a dataset of tens of millions of sequences, ErrorX can pinpoint with extremely high accuracy positions where an error was likely introduced, saving valuable time and energy by removing these bases from further analysis. In benchmark studies, ErrorX was able to remove up to 36% of errors from a dataset with a false positive rate of less than 0.05%.

ErrorX currently supports processing of antibody and T-cell repertoire sequencing data from human and mice, gathered on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq instruments.


Installation2
=============

To install ErrorX, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/sevya/errorx/releases) page on the ErrorX Github account. Once you have downloaded the zipped archive for your operating system (this will have the extension `.tar.gz`), you are ready to unpack the folder and starting running.

Run the following command to extract the files from the archive:

	tar xvfz ErrorX-1.1.0_mac.tar.gz
You can also use a third-party software such as [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the files. 
	
The ErrorX binary is ready to go from there - it is located at `ErrorX/bin/errorx`

**Note:** the binary relies on data contained in the ErrorX folder. For best results, leave the directory structure of ErrorX intact.
